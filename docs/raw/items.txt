Chartering and Field of Membership for Federal Credit Unions-Interpretive Rulings and Policy Statements
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2026/02/11/2026-02765/chartering-and-field-of-membership-for-federal-credit-unions-interpretive-rulings-and-policy
The NCUA Board proposes to rescind its Interpretative Ruling and Policy Statement 06-1 (IRPS 06-1). Rescinding IRPS 06-1 would ease the compliance burden on Federal credit unions (FCUs) by limiting the number of sources that FCUs must check to ensure compliance with applicable chartering and field of membership (FOM) requirements.
